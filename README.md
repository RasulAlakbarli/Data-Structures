# **Data Structures in C++**

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures. This repo is created to help beginners like me understand the basics of data structures and algorithms and learn c++ programming.

## **Implemented Data Structures**

1. **Singly Linked List**
   - **Operations**:
     - Insertion at the beginning
     - Insertion at the end
     - Deletion at the beginning
     - Deletion at the end
     - Traversal
   - **Key Features**:
     - Efficient insertion using `head` and `tail` pointers.
     - Memory safety with a destructor to avoid memory leaks.
   - [Source Code](./LinkedList.cpp) 

---

## **Planned Implementations**
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack (using arrays and linked lists)
- Queue (simple and circular)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Hash Table
- Graph (Adjacency List and Matrix)
